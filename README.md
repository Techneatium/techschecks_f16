## WHAT IS THIS?

- A kneeboard-style `cheatsheet` for the DCS F-16C
- Intended to allow someone already knowledgeable about the tomcat's systems to quickly find necessary information
- For ease of maintenance, only the PDF is available here. To convert this to a format directly suitable as an in-game kneeboard please use [DCS Kneeboard Builder](https://dcskneeboardbuilder.com/).

## COOL FEATURES

Or at least what *I* think is cool.

### Hyperlinks. Lot's of Hyperlinks

To facilitate quick location of the desired information the front page's chevrons/thumbtabs act as hyperlinks to the relevant chapters. Then, the mini-table-of-contents at the start of each chapter are also hyperlinks to the sections and subsections. Finally, one can return to the front page at any time simply by clicking on the hatching at the top of the page in order to find the next piece of information.

### Thumbtabs

The front page chevrons and thumbtabs on the chapter pages are not just for show. If printed and cut they should act in much the same way as the thumbtabs on typical in-cockpit checklists. Additional cut lines are provided on odd pages as necesary.

### Styling

While the styling of this document is in no ways completely representative of actual documentation, it was chosen to feel *inspired* by actual NATOPS and Emergency Checklists.
