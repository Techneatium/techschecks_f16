# F-16C CHEATSHEET

## WHAT IS THIS?

- A kneeboard-style `cheatsheet` for the DCS F-16C
- Intended to allow someone already knowledgeable about the tomcat's systems to quickly find necessary information
- For ease of maintenance, only the PDF is available here. To convert this to a format directly suitable as an in-game kneeboard please use [DCS Kneeboard Builder](https://dcskneeboardbuilder.com/).

## HOW TO USE

- Just download the PDF and use as desired
- The remaining files are the LaTeX source code

## WORK IN PROGRESS

- **Guide is essentially in pre-alpha** - nothing is fixed, formatting is unclear, all is experimental
  
### TO-DO

- `PROCEDURES`
  - `START-UP`
    - Requires all diagrams (currently just placeholders)
