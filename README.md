This is a guide for the DCS F-16C designed as a reference work to allow users to quickly look up what they need to know. It is intended to fill the spot in between the excellent guides Chuck, and full aircraft manuals provided by the developers. At the same time we leverage LaTeX to add quality of life features for the reader.

The "Gold Edition" label signifies a collaboration with [Goldwolf](https://www.reddit.com/user/goldwolf) to include custom figures and illustrations.

## Features

- Inspired by and intended to be _reminiscent_ of real aerospace documentation
- **100% custom vector graphics and figures** made by [Goldwolf](https://www.reddit.com/user/goldwolf)
  - location of switches and panels indicated for procedures
  - illustrations of HUD, MFD, and HMD symbology
- **Compact size** (< 2 Mb) ensures quick loading
- Lots of hyperlinks to enable **quick navigation**
  - from the front page to each chapter (simply click on the chapter name)
  - from any location you can click on the header to return to the front page
  - both the chapter and section name are hyperlinks to their beginnings respectively
- Local tables of contents at the start of each chapter
- **Custom F-16 fonts** by [Morkvitnir](https://www.reddit.com/user/morkvitnir9) for use in figures

## Installation

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/Techneatium/techschecks_f16/releases) and download the latest PDF, then use as desired. The remaining files are the LaTeX source code

For ease of maintenance, no image file versions are maintained here. To convert this to a format directly suitable as an in-game kneeboard (e.g PNG) please use [DCS Kneeboard Builder](https://dcskneeboardbuilder.com/)
