\begin{tcoloritemize}
    \blueitem{HAD Information}{
        The HAD contains all the same information as the HSD, including WPTS, DataLink targets, and range rings.}
    \blueitem{Usage}{
        Flying diagonally to the target is best to triangulate the position of the radar. The HAD will display a PGM index that
        represents the level of trust in the accuracy of the contact, with lower being better. It is recommended to wait for at 
        least PGM2 for optimal results. 
        HARM is launched in POS mode, flying to estimated location given by HAD before using its own seeker.

    \blueitem{Track Information}{
        \begin{subitemize}
            \item[Green] Emitter not active but detected once / Emitter behind 3-9 line\\
            \item[Yellow] Emitter is acitve in Search mode
            \item[Red (Steady)] Emitter is active in Track mode
            \item[Red (Flashing)] Emitter is active in Launch Mode
            \item[Yellow Boxed] Primary target Selected
            \item[Red Boxed] Primary target Handed off
        \end{subitemize}}
    \blueitem{Switchology}{
    \begin{subitemize}
        \item \textbf{Designate Primary Target/Handoff} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{TMS} \dotfill \textbf{Up}
        \end{itemize}
        If another contact is designated, the previous primary target becomes a Priority target.
        \item \textbf{Cycle Priority Targets}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{TMS} \dotfill \textbf{Right}
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Remove Priority Targets}
        When cursor on a target
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{TMS} \dotfill \textbf{Down}
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Remove All Targets}
        When cursor on nothing
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{TMS} \dotfill \textbf{Down}
        \end{itemize}
