\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{HOW TO WIN}
\begin{tcoloritemize}
    \blueitem[Goal]
    The ultimate goal of any air-to-air engagement is to kill the enemy without being killed. 
    Working backwards, we first define our desired end state:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item bandit is destroyed, preferably due to fighter ordnance
        \item fighter is undamaged and remains combat effective
    \end{itemize}
\end{tcoloritemize}

\subsection{OVERVIEW}
\begin{tcoloritemize}
    \blueitem[Fundamentals] 
    In \cref{subsec:bvr}, 
    we examine the fundamentals of BVR engagements, 
    explaining the typical flight profile of an active radar missile,
    define the ranges which are relevant for tactical employment,
    as well as how the fighter and bandit can each effect these ranges

    \blueitem[Intercept Timelines]
    In \cref{sec:ttp_aa:timelines}, 
    we then discuss basic intercept timelines, 
    defining how to prosecute individual contacts while leveraging the capabilities of the AIM-120
    
    \blueitem[Formation]
    \Cref{sec:ttp_aa:form} describes basic formation keeping, the foundation of multiship employment
\end{tcoloritemize}
